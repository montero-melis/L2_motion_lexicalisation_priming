TO DO
=====

- The current analyses are double-counting baseline participants: what shall we do about this?
- Follow-up GLMM on Q3: 
	- how to bin participants by proficiency?
	- Use forward coding comparing L2 low > L2 high > natives
- Was Flo going to try out something using multinomial regression?

--> I've emailed Flo about these issues (180903)


Reporting the analysis
----------------------

Check out "Analysis approach" section in Fraundorf & Jaeger (2016, p.35)


Discussion
----------

- Generally stronger overall priming in L2ers vs natives
- Why upward trend (path verbs) and downward trend (manner verbs) over course of experiment? See Kootstra&Doedens 2016
