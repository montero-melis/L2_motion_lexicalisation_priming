## Look into increasing trend for path verb production in baseline condition

# Reviewer 2 from BLC pointed out that
# "The L1 native dataset has an unexpected pattern such that the rates of path
# verbs increase over the course of the experiment. [...] This may be contribu-
# ting to the small priming effects and what looks like an inverse preference
# effect. Especially given that this doesnâ€™t happen in the L2 group to the same
# extent, I think this is worth mentioning as a limitation of the dataset."

# We here look into the reviewer's observation that this pattern holds for L1
# speakers more than for L2 speakers.
