TO DO
=====

- Figure out what script I used to generate the figures for my thesis chapter?

- Run GAMM analysis with only the data from the two manner verbs that were better known to subjects [almost finished!]
- Replace Figs. 5&6 in thesis' Study III with figures that show the difference (as in lower panels of Figs 3&4)
- Model comparison showing that 3-way interaction with proficiency significantly improves the model for L2 speakers adaptation to manner verbs


Reporting the analysis
----------------------

Check out "Analysis approach" section in Fraundorf & Jaeger (2016, p.35)


Discussion
----------

Why upward trend (path verbs) and downward trend (manner verbs) over course of experiment? See Kootstra&Doedens 2016
