- Should the analyses in any way be related to the results from the nonverbal task (Montero-Melis et al 2016 in LL)?

Main results
------------

As summarised on 22 Jan before meeting with Manne:

Guiding motif:
Swedish L2 speakers of Spanish adjust to target language (TL) lexicalisation patterns already at intermediate levels of proficiency, showing little evidence of L1 influence.

a) [Control cond.] L2-speakers converge towards target-like use of Path verbs, even though S-framing is possible and relatively frequent in the TL.
b) [Control cond.] L2 speakers include Manner information less often in their descriptions than NS, despite this information being always encoded in their L1.
c) [Path/Manner priming] When Path- or Manner-primed, L2 speakers are affected in the same way as NS, showing no evidence that their L1 knowledge mediates priming effects.
d) [Manner priming] Specifically, seeing evidence of Manner verbs (similar to their L1) does not induce a full switch to this pattern
e) [Proficiency] With increasing proficiency, L2 speakers tend to encode Path more often in the main verb (but not in adjuncts)
f) [Proficiency] With increasing proficiency, L2 speakers tend to encode Manner more often as an adjunct (but not as a main verb)
g) [Proficiency] With increasing proficiency, L2 speakers tend to encode Manner despite being Path primed -- i.e. they resist against priming
